This maybe the only mall that has boat inside on top of real water. Kinda nice while dine in n listening to the sound of water at the same time. Quite therapeutic really, especially if it is not too crowded.

Pacific Place Mall,Pramuaji Pramono,4.0,"One of several ""High Class"" Malls of Jakarta. Neatly located at the heart of Semanggi Central Business District. Reachable by public transportations: Istora Mandiri MRT Station and Polda Metro Jaya Transjakarta shelter.

No in-building parking for motorcycles. No local bookstore (there's only a Books & Beyond), and no ""people's junk food"" joint (Wendy's is the closest one).

The musholla is clean and comfortable. Just not that big of a space to fit many people."

Pacific Place Mall,ENDAH,5.0,First time go to this mall for refreshing with my bestie. We are to be Metropolitan People on one day. This mall is different from another mall. Many objects that can to be spot photos and so luxurious.
Pacific Place Mall,Paul Renon,1.0,Probably the worse parking space. Closing the lower space without any clear reason and you just go around and around looking for a spot which is less wide than the car… mind blowing when you’re actually paying for the space and this is a premium mall… guess you have to spend more per hour for a self parking valet spot
Pacific Place Mall,Erniyati Fun,5.0,"This is very nice upscale mall. You can find most of the high end brands you love here. To me, this is my perfect shopping paradise in Jakarta. Typically not busy during week days, but also not too crowded during weekend and public holidays too. I did a small social experiment here. When I came all dress up with nice shoes and designer bags, all the sales persons are so friendly and approaching to offer their product, but when I came with short & sneakers, no one even notice me. So the next time you visit this mall, please expect that people do look at you from the way you look, and for sure, little did they judge how much money you have, simply from your appearance. This sounds mean but this is business. Because in fact, you don't find anything cheap here. Even the simple cosmetic stand there, can costs around IDR 2million for 1 small cup of face lotion.  But the foods and restaurants here, they have average price like many other mall in Jakarta."
Pacific Place Mall,Teguh haryanto,5.0,"Mall nya oke juga barang barang nya branded dan highend, toilet baik sekali parkiran luas di basement.

(Translated by Google)
Very good mall, the goods are branded and high end, the facilities function well, enter this mall by security check, the lighting is very good and clean, the toilets are very good, there is a large parking area in the basement."
Pacific Place Mall,Gaius Leong,4.0,"Decent mall with multiple entrances, so it gets a little confusing. Shops open only around 10am in general, so don't come here too early. Even cafes, despite opening at 10am, are still very much mentally asleep. Prices here are not cheaper than in Singapore."
Pacific Place Mall,Ezra Natalyn,4.0,Quiet good place. Providing high brands inside and many restaurants too.
Pacific Place Mall,Abbott Hsu,5.0,"One of luxurious malls in Jakarta. It is hot and crowded in weekdays since people working around SCBD go there for lunch or business purposes. On the contrary, good for people go shopping since it is quiet during weekends.
Kidzana, CGV cinemax are attractive on weekends or holidays. To be honest, the space is really big for you to relax yourselves there.
Fancy foot court here is another landscape inside. Photo shooting here appeals people all the time. Good place to hangout on weekends or holidays. Just come and enjoy yourself here."
Pacific Place Mall,Krisanto Purnawan,5.0,"Prestigious mall in south jakarta. You can find branded stores here and fine dining restaurants and food courts also. Not to mention cinema here.

Pondok Indah Mall 1,Pandapotan Siagian,4.0,"Went here just to play at Playtopia.
It is located near waterpark, south area of PIM 1. The playground is not that big but enough for kids to play around. The ticket during weekend is 150k IDR, with 3 hours playing.
Honestly its a bit “force ticket”, because we can not buy less than 3 hours, and if we played only 1 hour, there is no savings for next time.
But overall it was ok."

Pondok Indah Mall 1,Bull Dogg,5.0,"Jakarta has several upscale malls and this is one of the top three in terms of scale, premium brands, and location. Although the streets around the mall frequently are congested, the opening hours make the mall nicely accessible if you avoid the rush hours. There is ample self and valet parking.
The mall has three different buildings so it can take a while to find the store you are looking for. Pretty much every premium brand can be found, as well as many small specialty stores that are not part of a chain.
There is a large number of restaurants of various kinds and food types. As Indonesians love fast food the majority of restaurants are of that kind. But there are also a few more upscale restaurants, both Indonesian and other nationalities.
The restrooms, and the mall in general, are very clean, constantly attended to.
There also are several activity areas for children.
This mall is the favorite pastime of many families in Jakarta."

Pondok Indah Mall 1,Pramuaji Pramono,5.0,"Back in the day, before PIM 1 had a major renovation, there was a disparity between the 2 malls. PIM 1 was for the ""mid-to-low"" level, and PIM 2 was for the haves of upper-class.

Now, there's no such difference. I even like PIM 1 better! It has my 3 minimum ""requirements"" for a worth-to-visit mall: 1. Budget friendly restaurant (HokBen, Bakmi GM), 2. Bookstores (Gramedia and Periplus), and 3. Movie theatre (XXI).

As the malls (1 to 3 + street gallery) have an outside-the-building motorcycle parking. PIM 1 is the closest building to it. Me, personally, I'd prefer to take the TransJakarta (koridor 8) to get here."

While there are some tenants closed in PIM 1 and PIM 2, the PIM 3 still offer some new tenants.

The new attraction is At Most Fear, the glass floor area in second floor. Visitors can enter the area based on limited group about 20 peoples handled by the security and given about 20 minutes to enjoy and take photos around. The place itself actually not too high but still worrying for some people. Hahaha. I prefer to come there at night since the city light intersection of PIM 1 and PIM 2 look great.
It is free area to visit but there are queue sometimes. No heels or pointed heels allowed to protect the glass floor.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying it's a bad place. But the thing is, this mall has been well described by other reviewers. It would be redundant to add the same details.

Okay some brief, f̲o̲r̲ ̲m̲e̲, Senayan City is a cozy place to hang out and spend time with family. Especially for having dinner.
The location is very strategic and easy to reach. As the name implies: ""Senayan""
That's it for now. I may add more details later.

Senayan City,Gatot Bramanto,4.0,"Inside mall ok. Problem only finding parking..and especially finding the way for reaching exit gateway.

Senayan City,Anggita Damayanti,2.0,"one of the best malls in Jakarta, but it's a shame it has unfriendly security, I visited wearing sandals and my skin was a little dark, all the women who entered were greeted kindly, there were large bags still given a box to enter the x-ray machine, even though my bag was so small, they just put it away, and gave my bag a weird look."
Senayan City,Lobelia Asmaul Husna,5.0,"One of the biggest mall in Jakarta. Good place for shopping, but need to improve the parking area on a big day. I was stuck and not moving at all about 30 minutes in the basement.

The Darmawangsa Square,Vilia Ciputra,5.0,"A small and kinda old mall, but very well-taken care of. The tenants were curated well, pretty complete as in you could find many different type of businesses here, from cafe, supermarket, to dentist, physiotherapist, etc.

The mall was calm and has a classic interior style.   The crowds are more to working people, so you'll get the calm ambience which makes it a good place to read or have a cup of coffee with friends.

Will definitely be back."
The Darmawangsa Square,arantan saranto,5.0,"The only reason I went here is because there is Avenue 8. Its a very small mall, some few good restaurants but pricey and the parking space is adequate.

There is also sukaoutdoor too, small store which sells special brands for runners and cyclist."
The Darmawangsa Square,Dean Chen,4.0,"its a small mall but pretty cozy, kinda reminds me of a small town shopping center.

but wait! theres moooOre!.... theres more shops in the basement!... oh mine a tiny Japanese restaurant! nicely done guys  ."

Mostly occupied by korean style hair saloons, restaurants, then fitness centre, pilates n yoga studio, art galleries, clothing store, restaurants n supermarket, offices, tile shop etc.
Limited parking space here. VIP parking spot available for fee 50 k.

Came here for a nostalgic vibe"

On the ground floor there are a couple of restaurants (Japanese, Indonesian and western) there is a Ranch Market for grocery shopping, and a couple of boutiques. On the upper floors there are a couple more boutiques and restaurants and also a travel agent.

The prices here a a bit expensive compared to other shopping malls.

Then several competitor built shopping center too in nearby area with more complete and bigger area. Long story short, pandemic came and it is affecting this place.

The Darmawangsa Square,Virna AR,5.0,"Quite, calming place for working. Need grocery? No worries, there is Ranch market. Lunch? Teras Dharmawangsa, your hair messy? The Parlour"
The Darmawangsa Square,Ibrahim R. Hakim,5.0,"The Darmawangsa Square

The Dharmawangsa Square is a mini mall in the heart of Dharmawangsa area that consist of various restaurants, shops, beauty clinics, and many others. This mini mall is also connected to a hotel called The 101 Dharmawangsa, which makes it very convenient for the guests staying at the hotel if they are looking for something to eat or something to buy.

You can find popular coffee chains in this mini mall, such as Starbucks, Coffee Beans or Kopi Tator. Furthermore, this mall also has a supermarket (Farmer's Market) for your grocery needs.

The mall itself is not too crowded like many other or larger shopping malls in Jakarta, which makes it a very relaxing experience if you just want to find something to eat.

However, my problem with this mall would be the parking space. It has an outside ground-level parking space, as well as basement parking space. It can be very hard to find parking on the outside parking space. However, the outside parking space is still preferable compared to the basement one. This mall has four entrances which are easily accessible for people who are parking on the ground level.

Meanwhile, the basement parking space is quite narrow and badly ventilated. The stair access to go to the mall's lobby is also limited, which makes it inconvenient to park down there. Furthermore, there is a prayer room in the basement parking area but I can boldly say it is extremely unsatisfactory as it is too small, damp, and quite a hassle to access it."
The Darmawangsa Square,Ivan Aditia,4.0,"Nice little European style shopping arcade with some cafes, restaurants and a supermarket. Good place for having small meetings or those who stays at The 1O1 Sedayu Dharmawangsa hotel next door are looking for something to eat but don't want to eat at Kemang or anywhere else. The only cons here is the basement parking area which is limited and quite narrow."

An iconic landmark, stands resolute in the present era, bearing witness to the passage of time. Despite the changing tides of modernity, it remains a cherished relic of the past, exuding a timeless charm that captivates all who visit.

Melawai Plaza,Ivan Aditia,3.0,"An old shopping center from 1983, and a well known place for golds and jewelries. This place has definitely seen better days; it is now a run down creepy looking place, let alone with its retro 1980s ambience. Only the ground and first floors are usually crowded thanks to the number of jewelry and gold shops, while the rest are like a ghost town. Those floors used to have department store and a supermarket which have long gone. The top floor now houses a mosque."
Melawai Plaza,Colin Anderson,5.0,"This is a great mall. Some might find it old but there is nothing wrong with being antique.

Mal Ambasador,WintorialsLift,4.0,"A nice mall, however the one I want to focus on is the elevators and escalators. Seems that the service elevators (Lift 4 and 5) need a little bit of work on the flooring, and a particular escalator (East Atrium and it's one of them that goes to-from 1-2). Other than that, definitely a nice ""classic"" mall (commissioned in 1997) and I definitely recommend coming here if you need to buy general things like computers/phones, eat in a restaurant, etc."
