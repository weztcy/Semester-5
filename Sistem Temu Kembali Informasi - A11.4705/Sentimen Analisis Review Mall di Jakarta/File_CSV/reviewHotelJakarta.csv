Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,Yanee W,5.0,"Enjoyed our 2 nights at the Executive Suite. Room is very spacious, clean and adequate. I love how the room has full length mirror everywhere.
Breakfast spread is only ok. Food quality needs improvement. Service is good, no complaint. Thank you to Mira for taking care of us during breakfast.

Rooms: The Suite room is spacious, clean and has nice city view. Bathroom has nice bathtub with great view!"
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,Alfathania Syakura,5.0,"The room was amazing!!! We got an executive suite and the view was great! I had such a good night sleep there! We had breakfast in the hotel too! Mira was so nice! The milk was empty so I asked her if she can refill the milk and she personally send a glass of milk to my table. Besides, she could speak english so it’s easier for us to communicate what we want. Altho food quality still need a lot of improvement, I still enjoyed my breakfast here because of the service :)"
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,Mutia Aulia,5.0,"Having a great experience while staying here. The meeting room are so confy. Room is suitable and have a great view. Smells good also. Breakfast has many variance and taste good. All staff are helpfull especially ms Mira, shes kind and charming"
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,Ali Wafdi,5.0,"We enjoyed our stay at this hotel. The room was very well appointed, had a great view and the bed is comfortable. The staff is very helpful and responsive. On our first day, our room neighbors had 2 rooms and they were making so much noise in the hallway from 4:45am to 7am that it woke us up. The receptionist handled the situation very well and agreed to change our room. The only con I can see with the rooms is that you can hear your neighbor's room bell, which might bother you. We will definitely be back!"
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,Nadia Ladesma,5.0,"I had a great experience staying here. We only stayed for one night but it was a cozy and warm place to stay. The breakfast was excellent as it has variety of choices from western food to Indonesian food. The room was spacious, however I think the bathroom matt should be a bit thicker as it was so quick to get soaked. Overall, we had a nice stay here and would love to come again."
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,Felicia,5.0,"Xmas eve dinner at white rock, ordering their pasta and it’s taste really good. We also tried dragon sushi roll with prawn inside and unagi on top, the unagi really soft and tender. Last, Their service also awesome especially Mira. Thank you white rock."
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,Toh Heng Fatt,1.0,"What a rubbish Wi-fi in the room, i have been stay here for couple months, i have also complaint to the management so many times. They are still not trying to improve their Wi-fi quality. If you plan to working in this Hotel. Please think twice!! Besides that, the breakfast taste very bad, most of the time just repeating with the same breakfast, no new idea at all. Other than that, everything is fine."
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,Yessie,5.0,"Stayed here for 2 nights and have no complaints! The room is clean and spacious. Never had the chance to try the breakfast but my friend who's with me said it was good!

Also had a body glow massage at Alaya. My therapist, Diana, is good and i really enjoyed it.

Will definitely recommend it!"
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,Eileen Tam,5.0,"Front desk: Staff was very courteous, clear in explanation, helpful to make room arrangements; as best as they could to accommodate changes.
Room: Comfortable bedding, clean toilet and shower.
There was a faulty (flickering) light, which the technicians were very prompt to assist.
Just 1 thing which the hotel can consider for improvement: The hairdryer provided was of low wattage (not hot enough). But I understand that this is just a personal preference. :)
Thanks, Mercure Jakarta Gotot Subroto!"
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,Timora Wijayanto,5.0,"Nice experience staying for business trip in this hotel. Strategic location in the city. The room is spacious, neat and comfortable. Good food with several in-house resto and cafes. Nice gestures from one of the staff mbak Mira during breakfast time. It's just satisfying."
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,Andrew Ng,5.0,I was greeted by Mira at the Flora restaurant who worked here. She speaks fluent English and was very helpful in finding me a seat near to the entrance of the restaurant to make sure that I can still see my personal belongings while I get the food. Half way through my lunch she also asked me on the food quality and if there’s anything else I need. A great asset to the Company as she is very friendly with high quality of customer service and care.
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,Flora Barus,5.0,"Great location. Clean, comfortable, and spacious room. But my room has no wardrobe. Good city view. Delicious and various foods. Near public transportation. The best thing is they don't use water bottles. Instead they provide a water jar in the room and a water dispenser near the lift."
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,Sinta Kartika,5.0,"Nice hotel and comfy room with a great view. the breakfast has many variants of asian and indonesian food. the servive are execellent, specialy ms. Mira. thank you"
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,Kosario Mohammad Kautsar,5.0,"Keep up the good work! A bit concerns in breakfast this morning, you should come after 7am to let them set the breakfast completely. Thanks to Ms Nabila!
The room is spacious, good high rise semi indoor pools, cool wind exposed! The meals is so delicious in-room or even at the restaurant.
We got a bit problem, Mr Adi and Ms Sandra handled it very good directly.

Rooms: Room is spacious, non carpet floor is great, tidy, well cleanup by Mr Nashshar. Good service!

Walkability: Very close to public transport, instead of city taxi.

Food & drinks: I took breakfast at 5th floor around 7am, the taste of meals was great even though menu is limited! the next day I came around 9am and the set better and quicker service and clean up.

Noteworthy details: We got problem while order room service, it around 1 hour for complete the order"
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,Sally S,4.0,"Overall it was a very good stay.  Nice hotel in a great location and good value.
A couple of issues with
- check-in (no offer to take a deposit to charge to room, no upgrade for Gold status or welcome note/ gift in room),
- no Accor plus discount for alcohol, breakfast buffet was underwhelming
- wine excluded for Gold members free drinks
- pool area very crowded on a Sunday
- limited understanding of English by staff
- no desk in room for working
- error with Accor Plus nights and status points credited
- the music from the neighbourhood at 4am woke me up every night.

Rooms: Lovely room but I would have liked an upgrade with Accor Plus Gold status"
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,Mayette Quicho,4.0,"The hotel was the perfect location for our needs. Services were stellar, staff always very helpful.
Our room was spacious and comfortable and clean.
Breakfast at the restaurant was ample mainly Indonesian dishes.  Although because we stayed for a week, somehow it gets tiring having the same thing everyday. Maybe you can add more cuisines like Intercontinental.
We tried the Spa at the 17th Floor and booked for a couple’s massage. It was relaxing and just what we needed. Therapist Liya and Iin were very charming and competent at what they do.
Overall, experience was satisfactory and have met our expectations."
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,Dylan,5.0,"Great hotel, room is very spacious and clean, staff is super friendly and helpful. On each floor there is a water dispenser, the hotel does a great job by not using “single use plastic”.
Finally a hotel in Indonesia who gets it and is starting to make a difference !
Highly recommend this hotel."
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,Fanny Elias See,5.0,"Randomly booked a room for my short 2d1n getaway in Jakarta and i was pleasantly surprised at how new, clean and comfortable this place is. The front desk staff Salma was kind enough to extend late checkout for me as my flight was in the evening and although we came too early to checkin, she gave us drinks voucher so we could chill and wait at the in-house restaurant/cafe.

The room is spacious and very clean. The view from the room is spectacular, you can even enjoy the view of Jakarta from your bathroom while showering. The complimentary drinks in the minibar were also a nice touch. Overall a very good stay here!"
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,Henri Sihombing,5.0,"I had a very pleasant stay in Mercure Hotel Gatsu. Best room view, great facility, and many variety off breakfast menu. The Front Office staff was really helpful. The location of the hotel is great. Regards."
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,Rudy Setiawan,4.0,"The stay was good, as always good bed and pillow :) managed to sleep full 8-hours.
Apparently got a different layout for my room where the shower and the toilet bowl is in the same area (space). The toilet bowl got wet all the time after shower :D Other than all good! Wifi was awesome too! Good job!

I was not satisfied with the check-out process, did a deposit for my room but unable to process the refund for some reasons (never happened before). So I was asked to wait 14-days for the process to be completed and no void receipt was given at all."

Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,Hari Yanto,5.0,All service is OK. Breakfast also has many variance of indonesian food. Ms mira are helpfull during breakfast. Thank you
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,Kinanti Anindita,1.0,"The service from the front office was very bad; I had to wait a long time, but there were no officers who were noticed until we called one of them to help us. I couldn't check in because I didn't bring the physical voucher. I showed them the confirmation letter & softcopy of the voucher, but the officer rejected both documents. Come on… I just hope that there is at least a win-win solution from the hotel, but they didn’t offer any solution. Will definitely not come back.  "
Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,Ken Sofira,5.0,"Lovely hotel, nice and comfy room, great view, in city center. Breakfast are complete.

Hotel Mercure Jakarta Gatot Subroto,wiwin anggraini,5.0,"Is a good hotel to begin with, food and service was perfect. Mira one of the hotel staff was great staff very friendly and smiling. The only thing that could be improve to this hotel is the Internet, there is a time that Internet are not stable so is hard for us as a work traveler to rely on. Over all highly recommended to stay at Mercure Jakarta Hotel. :)

Food & drinks: The food is perfect I love mercure food."

Sutasoma Hotel,Shaina Gandanegara,5.0,"I had a delightful stay at Sutasoma Hotel. The place is exceptionally beautiful, and the staff members were incredibly accommodating. While the hotel might not be as expansive as it appears from the front, it still provided an enjoyable experience. The spacious beds and perfectly sized rooms made for a comfortable and cozy stay. I would definitely recommend it!

One added perk was the hotel's proximity to numerous Korean cuisine options, making dining choices both convenient and enjoyable during my stay.

Sutasoma Hotel,Feli Manda,5.0,"With magnificent and luxurious buildings like European buildings, it gives the impression of an expensive hotel, but this hotel is still affordable. Suitable for staycation and holidays with loved ones. The strategic location is easy to reach, the swimming pool is spacious and clean. Clean and luxury rooms make it comfortable to spend the night. This hotel is very recommended!!!"
Sutasoma Hotel,Renz Calub,5.0,Sutasoma Hotel has been our first home when we made our big move to Jakarta from the Philippines. We enjoyed our stay. The rooms are nice and spacious. The breakfast buffet is good and unforgettable because of the Indomie station! We hope to return to Sutasoma for a staycation or brunch soon!
Sutasoma Hotel,Mile R,3.0,"The hotel is conveniently located to the mall where restaurants, super market and drug store are there.
It’s a pity because……..:
The bathroom lacks Towel Rack, Hooks, Drawers.
When we entered, toilet seat was dirty, the washbasin water didn’t run smoothly.
Towels were greyish looking.
There was cockroache in the bathroom.
At the coffee shop, the rice was hard, it looked like the cheff was using old rice to make fright rice.
Room temperature was freezing, we couldn’t adjust it to lower."
Sutasoma Hotel,Trip.com Member,,I just live the environment at the hotel. Smell good! Breakfast also awesome. Very clean comfy and smell good in the room. Do maintain this environment for future! ❤️❤️
Sutasoma Hotel,Milah melati,5.0,"I love this hotel    Nice accommodation, nice service also the staff is so nice with us. Plus you can get great insta-picture with the surrounding of the hotel . It is actually the plus point     

Walkability: It is very near to the MRT"
Sutasoma Hotel,Kk Dede,5.0,"Amazing servicee! We had breakfast on our weekday, and greets by Mba Linda, and Mas Bisri, they offered us an omelette and a cup of coffee/tea, and they are very kindfull of act of service. Thank you so much"
Sutasoma Hotel,Trip.com Member,,"Nice design and basic room. Nothing much around the vicinity of the hotel even though it is in Dharmawangsa . . unfortunately the wrong side!So if you are looking for cafes, bars, eateries around the hotel better not stay here. This hotel is attached to a convention hall which I believe is popular for weddings. So could be crowded and noisy if there is a wedding or event going on. Breakfast was pretty good and affordable. Service overall is very good . . all the staff try to make the guests happy.The cafe food is ok if you stick to the standard Indonesian cuisine. We tried the Tom Yam Goong Soup and it was totally not right! But in all fairness the F&B manager did not charge us for it after we gave him the feedback.Will probably stay again if we have meetings that way."
Sutasoma Hotel,Zoe Lee,4.0,Overall was great and we enjoyed our stay here! The gym was limited and humid even with the AC turned on. We like the ambience of the room
Sutasoma Hotel,Lee Vai,5.0,"Dear Sutasoma Hotel,

Im am so grateful with this overwhelming welcome gift when im check in back to the hotel. Hotel was good,friendly staff and breakfast is awesome with few coffee beverages included. Would like to come back if visit jakarta again❤️.  Specially thank to Mr Riko from the front office manager for the excellent service.  - Crystal -"
Sutasoma Hotel,Jarupath Jitdoungprem (LordGift),5.0,"Very nice place and good service.

Breakfast lounge has many foods for foreigner. They can try Indonesian food or choose  their familiar.

Central heating may have some problem because it too slow to warm water.

The wall may be too thin because I can hear voices from  another room.

Sutasoma Hotel,renzy richie,5.0,"I've been 3 times stayed at Sutasoma Hotel and really enjoyed with the great hospitality from the staffs (especially Mba Nadia), prime location, super clean and ultra tidy rooms. I could say this is one of the hidden gems hotel at South Jakarta. Definitely will return to Sutasoma Hotel. Keep up the great work for Sutasoma Team!       "
Sutasoma Hotel,andar irwansyah,5.0,Really enjoyed my stay there.. I was in business trip & had a 2 days meeting next to the hotel.. the service was overall good & the rooftop dinner was fantastic
Sutasoma Hotel,Vidi,5.0,"Amazing stay, very unexpected! Every decoration and details (like the air freshener) was so pretty and traditionally elegant. Everything that's metal are gold-colored, adding to the elegant ambience. Great AC, in-room dining and room layout. Exceptional receptionists who keep on helping me for stuffs like printing my boarding pass and other small errands. The only minus were the shower that sounds a lot sometimes when it's not being used, and the other guests. Was unfortunate enough to be in the same floor as so many kids and family traveler who were very loud, ringing the doorbell a lot of time, and running around the corridor the whole time. Even ringing on my doorbell once as a mistake. But otherwise a great hotel!"
Sutasoma Hotel,JACQUELINE NATHALIA,5.0,"having two night stays and spending my beloved one birthday in sutasoma hotel was my best decission! their service are best! great companion, good food, nice ambience which made us feels like staying somewhere around greek and italia hehe for me, sutasoma are one of the best 4++ star hotel in town! i'd love to go back ;)"
Sutasoma Hotel,Fauziah Nurmiyati,5.0,Good location in South Jakarta. elegant lobby and comfy room. Big and comfortable bed. A lot of variation and delicious food during breakfast. The staff are also friendly and helpful.
Sutasoma Hotel,Mei Mei,4.0,"Nice hotel, smells really good. Room is clean and neat. Located in quiet street, very close to 2 korean supermarkets.

The room is not big but comfortable enough, with long seat by the window."
Sutasoma Hotel,Charmaine Yong,4.0,"Convenient location with cafes and restaurants nearby (skewed towards Korean and Japanese restaurants). Bed is very comfy and the room is very clean, the only issue was waiting for the iron and ironing board that took an hour to be sent to my room.  Had to call the reception 3 times but other than that, a very pleasant stay."
Sutasoma Hotel,Dania Sitadewi,5.0,There's a roach but we got free breakfast as sorry. So very good
Sutasoma Hotel,GD,5.0,"I was coming for having breakfast at Atman Lounge, and surprisingly they could accept outsider guest to enjoy the breakfast as well. A very warm welcome from the front desk Mas Adi, and he escorted me to restaurant and showing the room. During breakfast i was assisted by Mas Bisri and he was very kind and helpful.
At the moment Mas Adi came to my table and ask for further assistance, then i asked for room showing if possible and he assist me accordingly with informative detail explained.
I was thrilled by his exceptional hospitality. Thank you!"
Sutasoma Hotel,gabriella glady,5.0,"I had a great time stay at sutasoma hotel. Literally, If you are looking for an aesthetic hotel with an affordable price around South Jakarta recommended to stay here. Lokasinya persis di belakang tribrata.

Hotel 4 star ini memiliki Swimming Pool, Gym, dan juga rooftop nya with an amazing skyscraper view. Untuk room nya itu menurut aku luas dan nyaman. Aku stay di Kakawin Suite, dimana interior nya itu lebih elegant dan juga ada sentuhan indonesia nya. Room nya itu with a king size bed, marble bathroom, waterfall shower, and window seat.

its such a great place to stay if you wanna do staycation to escape from the hustle and bustle traffic of Jakarta.

Rooms: Its cozy and comfy

Nearby activities: Near malls, public transport, a lot of good restaurants around

Food & drinks: The food is delicious. I stay for 2 nights and the breakfast menu always change."
Sutasoma Hotel,Ria Alamin,5.0,"Been here twice. The check-in / check-out process was very fast,    for this! (I don't know the FO name but I recognize the necklace she wore).

The room is quite big and the AC is cold which I like it.
Please add face tissue on the table to make it completely perfect as tissue only available in the toilet.

The breakfast - many choices even they serve gula kapas for kids (need to stock it as many kids waiting for the staff to make it). Also thanks to pak Willy, his service is excellent. He serve the coffee to our table even he helped to clear the table.

After all I like the ambience, cleanliness and the service. Thank you."
Sutasoma Hotel,Maria Elsa,5.0,"I got the opportunity to stay at the Sutasoma Hotel on my vacation this year. The location is very strategic in South Jakarta. Breakfast was amazing with a variety of foods. The hotel is very comfortable and feels like home. The room is also clean and neat. Thanks to Amanda, who brought this memorable experience to me."
Sutasoma Hotel,Adri Dwitomo,4.0,"Stayed there with my eofe and 3months old. I can say that the stay was pretty enjoyable, the staff was helpful. There was an incident that happened when there was an event going on at the place. Cars piled up infront of the hotel lobby door and made other cars, my borthers couldn't move in the entrancenway because it was blocked. Nicked the cars bumper and yeah that was the only thing that made this review a 4 instead of a 5 star. There should be guards on duty 24/7 infront of the hotel entrance to make sure nothing like this happend. The staff apologized and habe us free breakfast along with a fruit platter. Aside from the the hotel itself is pretty quaint. It's a shame the walls are pretty thin, i could hear the other room laughing away at night. But hey they get to hear my baby cry too so..all in all would stay again as the location of the hotel is very strategic if your activities are around the south area of Jakarta. It's also very easy to go to center of Jakarta from the hotel being it positions itself at the center of the suburbs and the city.."
Sutasoma Hotel,Eva Kosasih,5.0,"Thank you for the hospitality, Sutasoma Hotel. And thanks for the anniversary decor and cake which exceed my expectations!

This hotel is so peaceful & quiet, perfect for staycation. It is located close to MRT Station which makes it more handy to move around in Jakarta :)

Food & drinks: They offer lots of option for breakfast. The food taste so delicious! I wish I have a bigger tummy! ^^"
Sutasoma Hotel,catur nila wardani,5.0,I love the ambiance. The staff is very helpful. Signals of mobile cellular is very bad in the room. But you can get wifi and its helpful. Breakfast menu is quite lot but the time of serving little bit slow.
Sutasoma Hotel,Martiana Sipahutar,5.0,"The hotel is located near Grand Wijaya Square, so there are plenty of restaurants around which I found as a plus point. The check in and check out services are efficient. The room is nice, clean, and comfortable, the only defficiencies are:
(1) that the sound travels from neighbouring rooms as well us upper rooms. I have to check and recheck the bathroom to ensure no leakage as the sound comes so loudly which apparently originates from the next bathroom; and
(2) that the hotel provides a water jug but no water dispenser to be seen at the alley. I don't know why. Tea is sariwangi, could be better.

The gym is small but convenient with the view to the pool, I enjoy it very much. Breakfast is good, especially the omelet, and service is excellent. Thanks Sutasoma, will return again when the renovation at level 8 is done."
Sutasoma Hotel,Aprila Annasi Casia,5.0,"The room is super cozy and clean. The stay is dedinitely worth the money. The staff are friendly. The front office team lead by windi made a memorable welcome on my arrival and they were always nice and friendly assisting me with my needs during the stay
Slightly improvement needed for the maintenance of gym equipment, and also the variety of breakfast could be added to have a better dining experience. The cappucino was awesome!"
Kemang Icon Jakarta,Astrid Augustrita,5.0,"I cannot rate the room as I did not stay in the hotel. This is my second time visiting the restaurant. We had a dinner event last night at the function room, and it was splendid!.
The buffet were tasty. I love the black pepper beef as well as the mushroom cream soup. Not to forget the fried banana and fried cassava for the snacks. The function room fit well for us around 30 pax. The long table set nicely with Christmas decoration. Thank you to Bapak Miftah and his team who served us with kindness and professionality. Location is also a plus point, just by the corner of the Kemang area which very easy to access and locate. Last but not least, this place has a very nice view from its rooftop. Visiting during sunset is recommended! Beautiful scenery. I am certain will revisit this place again."
Kemang Icon Jakarta,Gio Aguste,5.0,"I had a wonderful stay at Kemang Icon Jakarta. The suite I stayed in called Ionic suite, it was not only spacious but also uniquely decorated with a classic touch, giving it a charming ambiance.

The staff, while not numerous, were incredibly friendly and attentive. They made sure I had a comfortable and enjoyable experience throughout my stay.

While the breakfast was served à la carte rather than buffet-style, the food was absolutely delicious and satisfying.

Overall, Kemang Icon Jakarta impressed me with its spacious and charming suite, attentive staff, and delectable breakfast. It's definitely a hotel that maintains a high level of performance. Please keep the performance."

Kemang Icon Jakarta,Abbott Hsu,5.0,"A very well organized and delicate hotel in Kemang area. You can feel how the owner wants to create the modern and traditional atmosphere by having mixed decoration inside.
The staff are really friendly to serve you no matter in room service or at it's bistro. Though there are 12 rooms here, the overall maintenance and service are super good. A good place to stay on weekends or holidays at Kemang. Enjoy it."
Kemang Icon Jakarta,Josh Patil,1.0,"The worst hotel I’ve ever been too. Staff don’t care at all to help. Empty promises. Woke up to my room completely flooded in water the first morning. WiFi hasn’t worked for 2 days. Construction FROM the hotel starts at 7am and drills into the rooms from outside.

They have ZERO thought of customer service. A 1 star hotel under the disguise of a 4.

What a rip off."
Kemang Icon Jakarta,SelweN,5.0,"Very nice experience to me n my family stay at Kemang Icon

Rooms: Comfortable

Safety: Very safe

Food & drinks: Very good"
Kemang Icon Jakarta,Santino Pasini,1.0,"Kemang Icon by Alila was one of our favourite hotels and I have stayed here many times years ago. Today is my first visit here again after maybe 4 or 5 years. I was very excited for the great experience again. Then, we are shocked to see what we see today.

First of all, the furniture and the fixtures inside the room are not in good condition anymore. We can understand that for a hotel that is more than 10 years old. But what really upsets us is the broken elevator on our second day which has forced us to walk up the stairs to our room on the 3rd floor. I can handle this ‘exercise’ but we have our 75 years old mother with us and it is very hard for her to do that. What frustrating is the problem cannot be fixed promptly by the hotel. And there is no duty manager available on the premises!

Unfortunately the bad experience does not stop there. When we had our dinner at the edge restaurant, our tenderloin steak and rib eye steak were very dry and hard. It was far from juicy and soft meat that I remember when I ate here years ago. This time it really taste like a frozen meat that has been kept for days and not cooked properly at all.

I am very disappointed because I really liked this hotel before. Apparently, the hotel is not part of Alila anymore. Is this the reason of such a downgrade in quality? Current management of the hotel MUST do things right urgently if they still want to exist"
Kemang Icon Jakarta,Omri Ben-Canaan,5.0,"Kemang Icon is by far one of the best hotels I have stayed in in Jakarta.
Rooms are huge: 85sqm - Staff is super friendly and helpful and location is ideal, very central.
Restaurant is delicious with a lot of different cuisines so no need to venture outside or gojek anything.
There is a beautiful pool on the rooftop too.
Will definitely come back.
5 stars hands down."
Kemang Icon Jakarta,Berliano rex,5.0,Good room good ambience good food and beverage
Kemang Icon Jakarta,Dewi Wulandari,5.0,"I always have a special room in my heart for small hotels like this one. It only has 12 rooms BUT each room was uniquely designed, so each one is different. I stayed at illusion room, which was very spacious. It needs a bit of TLC on the interior but I heard it is scheduled for renovation. Mas Ilham the manager was very helpfull. Breakfast, wasn't buffet but you get to order from a list  that is all looked very delicious. I stayed here alone to get some me time and it's worth every dime. I got the sense of space and quietness that I dearly needed. And I already scheduled to come again on new year with my family. Conclusion? You should definitely put this hotel in your list"
Kemang Icon Jakarta,Erika HDRF,5.0,The vibe and the view was just perfect. We caught the sun as it was setting and the night lights were stunning. We got the advantage of using the upper room and the decor was wow. Great spots for a photo shoot. Oh and i suggest this place for private parties. Great place
Kemang Icon Jakarta,christiaan tumbelaka,2.0,"The place is nice and clean the staff is nice helpfull and polite
The Ceasars salat was bad no fress salat only 2 cherry tomato cut in half no black olive the chicken brest was dry and old.
And the Bufalo chickenwings was just reheaten frozen out of a pakage and dry too"
Kemang Icon Jakarta,Anita Maerani,5.0,"i love the unique design each room,giving the best ""me time"" experience. Also the pool area is my favorite spot to enjoy the sunset in the middle of crowded traffic. i pay what i deserve,very good job!"
Kemang Icon Jakarta,Jason Chan,4.0,Room is spacious. Unique design. Air con is very cold. I can't seem to able to find the remote. The hotel is very helpful. They prepare breakfast for early check out. Thumbs up
Hotel GranDhika Iskandarsyah,Arief,4.0,"This hotel was very jive actually. The service is good but they need to maintain their room better. Our room was with bathroom scale and the sink got clogged.

And this hotel is mainly for business trip and event. The view is nice, it was the flyover so its new for us.

Overall i would say its 4 out of 5"
Hotel GranDhika Iskandarsyah,Spanolier,2.0,"Decided to have family weekend getaway last month at this hotel after reading good reviews. Check-in was smooth & staff were friendly. We didn't check condition of our room and just left belongings in the room before going out for lunch. When we're back, my son went to the bathroom and fount out the tiles under the shower were dirty and there were hairs on them. Hotel staff asked permission to clean the bathroom (while we're in the room) but I requested to change room instead. It took more less 30mins from reporting time up to changing the room. Beside the small lamp next to the bed hanged unsymmetrically due to loose screw & we found not-too-big brown-stain on the sheet, the new room was clean"
Hotel GranDhika Iskandarsyah,Patria Nurhari,4.0,"We chose this accommodation for its strategic location for our purposes. The room and foods were okay. However, there’s issue with their service that need to be improved. It’s hospitality business after all."
Hotel GranDhika Iskandarsyah,Trip.com Member,,"Receptions are very nice. The room is comfortable and clean. There many interesting places around here such as shopping mall, mrt station. It's very convention to use every transportations. It's very good experience here. I love it."
Hotel GranDhika Iskandarsyah,Lukman Tanjung,5.0,The room might not be very spacious but it is clean enough. I love the use of the glass bottle instead of plastics. The staffs are friendly as well.
Hotel GranDhika Iskandarsyah,Ira Dani Asalia,1.0,I was in a rush and they said the food will be done in less than 15 mins so i ordered. But they made me wait 40 minutes. a pasta? And simple soto for such big well known hotel? Really? The workers said NOTHING about it as well. Disappointing   
Hotel GranDhika Iskandarsyah,Trip.com Member,,"Because it only takes 5 minutes to walk to the company, I chose this place, and I don’t have to worry about traffic jams every day   The hotel is indeed a bit old, but the breakfast is very good, the service staff are very polite, and the service is relatively good. Swimming pool is also available. There is a convenience store opposite the hotel; there is also BlokM, a restaurant, and a food street on the basement level. It's okay to stay for a business trip. If it is a vacation, it may not be suitable."
Hotel GranDhika Iskandarsyah,Monica R S,5.0,"Did not stay here but had a work function at one of their meeting rooms for 3 days. Wifi is fast, food is excellent. The lunch buffet is probably one of the best in Jakarta (it ranks high alongside the big five star hotels). The food is mostly Indonesian but the taste is top notch! My colleagues raved about how good the food is, we would come back for seconds!    Thanks Kresna for the attentive service"
Hotel GranDhika Iskandarsyah,Moses Heryanto - TX TRAVEL Bogor,4.0,"Good location, just 5mnt walking distance from BlokM Bus terminal. Come for meeting in 18th fl."
Hotel GranDhika Iskandarsyah,Ari,4.0,"I recently stayed at Grandhika during a business trip. The room was comfortable and met my needs adequately. The food at the hotel was decent, though not exceptional. What really stood out was the strategic location of Grandhika, which made it convenient for my business activities in the area."
Hotel GranDhika Iskandarsyah,Chris Garrett,1.0,"False advertising. This place is a dump. Yes it's cheap, but I chose it due to location for a meeting 1) they claim to have a gym and still show photos of it. They shut it down three years ago. They told me they receive many complaints but for some reason have decided to not change the website (to lure in more guests) 2) the walls in my room were dirty, scuffed and marked up 3) there were 3 lights in my bedroom that couldn't be shut off with a switch so I had to take the key out of the wall unit, and sleep in the heat.   Some of the staff were friendly, but clearly the management are squeezing every last penny out of this place while they run it into the ground. Do not stay here."
Hotel GranDhika Iskandarsyah,Trip.com Member,,"One of the best service I ever got. Rooftop is amazing but closes by 9 pm and not open untill 5 pm.Close to the market, malls, metro and business center."
Hotel GranDhika Iskandarsyah,Rahadian,3.0,"We went to lowest basement using their small elevator to get to the parking lot, and then suddenly a bellboy and a guest enter the elevator from the lobby floor with his huge luggage carrier that almost fill the entire elevator space, make us very uncomfortable and difficult to get out from the elevator. And guess what, their destination are the upper level, probably the guest room. Can't they even wait until the elevator back from the basement to the upper level? Very inconsiderate towards other guest."
Hotel GranDhika Iskandarsyah,Y S,4.0,"Hotel service is ok but the location is not good enough to travel from here. Bit far from train station, bus station. Taxi can’t easy to get inside to wait, need to get out from hotel and stay at outside on the road."
Hotel GranDhika Iskandarsyah,See Chai Ho,3.0,Near …to train and local people/ local life ..  you will enjoy walking around . Japanese food and supermarket around too..
Hotel GranDhika Iskandarsyah,RIZKI BALA,5.0,"the rooms are comfortable, clean and spacious, the food for breakfast is also delicious"
Hotel GranDhika Iskandarsyah,Luc Haas,5.0,"Comfortable, clean, convenient, friendly service, fair price, great location, excellent breakfast. Our place of choice in Jakarta."
Hotel GranDhika Iskandarsyah,James Kayle Labasano,5.0,I stayed for 1 month and never disappoints. Breakfast is yummy and customer service is so good.
Hotel GranDhika Iskandarsyah,Cindy Stefanie,5.0,"Had almost a full week staying at Grandhika hotel and the service is excellent.
Mr. Syam helped me through the check out situation as I carried a lot of luggage with me. The room is also comfortable and well cleaned.
The only minus is that the room is a little bit dark and doesn’t have a lot of bright lights at night."
Hotel GranDhika Iskandarsyah,Yi De Fong,4.0,"I'm a long stay guest at this hotel (3 months). I've been here for 1 month and can say I'm quite impressed with the service. In particular, Qori, Endang and Iman from the housekeeping team have been very friendly with good attention to details.

Only downside is that the maintenance and quality of the rooms can be a bit lacking. For instance, the walls are quite thin so I can hear the person in the next room snoring and get woken up by alarm clocks in other rooms as well. My room also started leaking badly when it rained - they transferred me to another room promptly though."
Hotel GranDhika Iskandarsyah,Arung Isyadi,5.0,"IMHO, this is the best hotel if you're planning to explore southern Jakarta and still can go back to a comfortable bedroom. The restaurant at the rooftop is great but cook a bit long for a fried rice, the breakfast is good but nothing special except for the instant noodle menu. Overall a very satisfying experience staying 3 nights here!"
Hotel GranDhika Iskandarsyah,Lena Zarkowska,5.0,"Most amazing hotel in Jakarta for a very reasonable price. The staff were so helpful and friendly, particularly Sam from reception who looked after our bags after checkout untill our flight so we could explore the city. He also found me a sewing kit to fix my backpack which broke which was extremely kind. The breakfast was also amazing and one of the most varied we have had throughout our two months in Indonesia. We will certainly be coming back here if we are in Jakarta again!!"
Hotel GranDhika Iskandarsyah,Denise Ding,2.0,"This hotel is in a convenient location, and has the basic amenities that a business traveler needs.
The positives end there.

The rooms are in a poor condition (the lights/ac in my room either would not turn on, or would not turn off), cleanliness is mediocre at best (found hair from a previous guest in the bathroom when I checked in, a towel had stains), the walls are thin (I can clearly hear my neighbor’s TV), and worst of all - the reception staff are negligent, bordering on rude."
Hotel GranDhika Iskandarsyah,hendri mustar,5.0,"Perfect location, on the free odd/even street. Nice food"
Hotel GranDhika Iskandarsyah,Dorothea Cindy,1.0,"Reserved 4 connected rooms, came at 12. Front office told us to wait till 1pm for room to be prepared. Until 3pm still have to wait for the room to be prepared. No proper lobby to wait.

4.24PM finally got the other 3 rooms after waited for 4,5 hrs.

Poor service. Room corridor's ceiling looks disgusting with leaking & mushroom stain.

Let's see how the new year's eve event will go. Already have bad experience & mood since arrived here.

The worst hotel service I've ever experienced
REALLY NOT RECOMMENDED TO STAY HERE!

Edit : the food taste and restaurant service was good. If you want to come, just come to try their meals, not to stay. For 4 stars hotel quality, the service was absolutely hilarious"
Hotel GranDhika Iskandarsyah,Bambang Tri,1.0,"Meeting room was ok, but amazingly no business centre to print document, also the toilet near the meeting room was dark, wet and dirty. Amazingly Gym,spa and pool was closed on saturday.
Not a pleasing experience for both business and leisure"
Hotel GranDhika Iskandarsyah,Trip.com Member,,"The hotel is relatively old, and the bathroom lights and exhaust fans cannot be turned off.Booked a non-smoking room, arranged a smoking room. After talking with the front desk for a long time, I agreed to change it on the same day!"
Hotel GranDhika Iskandarsyah,Eric Effin' P - MTB Content,4.0,"Location is good as it's at Block M area so it's strategic.
Senayan / scbd / kemang / Gandaria.

Had the room service, it's quite nice and the portion was very good!

The only thing bad about this hotel is the lobby. If there are guests who think that with an expensive car, they can take own sweet time, then be prepared to wait. The lobby is very narrow.

The WIFI is quite good too.

If you want view, stay along the road but if you want the noise too.
Else, stay opposite to get away from the main road.

Air con was Antarctica cold and all else works well!"
Hotel GranDhika Iskandarsyah,Albertus Fuad PHS,5.0,"Tops: helpful, accomodating, and friendly staffs; great location; tasty and balanced food; clean room.
I ordered room service during my quarantine stay and the restaurant staff recommended a cheaper similar menu after I asked about allergens, good job!

Tips: soundproofing might need more work as I could hear clearly the noise from the street. It also would be much better if the internet were fast enough for a smooth Teams/Zoom meetings.

Overall impression: nice hotel with their staffs as their best asset. Worth the cost."
Hotel GranDhika Iskandarsyah,Endang Rinasih Pakso Wati,5.0,"I love this place, it’s a very nice place to stay if you want to be in the middle of shopping area. The room is super clean, the bed is very comfortable too. The breakfast menu is nice and has a lot of variations. The pool is not big but very comfy and clean, the water doesn’t cause irritation. I love the pool because it feels like a private pool. The service is very good, they also check with us directly if we have any complain. The technician will be immediately sent to do maintenance if we need help. The cost of the room is average, very worth money we spent. Overall, my stay there is wonderful. I will definitely visit again."
Veranda Hotel Pakubuwono,Robert Mulyono Putra,5.0,"This hotel is good, it gives quiet, peaceful vibe in the busy Jakarta, the Gym small but still can satisfy my need for pumps, open from 06AM till 09PM, got Apples and Oranges in the bowl, serve free water and Orange infusion Water, the Machine all are good.

Swimming pool last time the water is not so fresh, maybe too much chlorine or something, so my skin got itchy and hurt.

Room is clean, have a nice fragrance, bed is hard but comfy so can maintain posture, pillow was great very comfy, the table is long and big very functional, not so many charging place but still Ok.

Breakfast got many choices, but all noodle variant everyday were overcooked until soggy.
The other menu was great. Service is good. I love this hotel.

The location is not too prime for me but Still OK for Business trips."
Veranda Hotel Pakubuwono,Ahmad Marzuki,5.0,"One of the most comfortable hotels I have ever visited, with its spacious lobby, very comfortable, clean, and well-maintained rooms, incredibly friendly, responsive, and efficient staff. It makes me want to return to stay here again soon. And one of the most enjoyable moments was having a delicious breakfast with a variety of menu options, along with a view of the pool and the green trees surrounding it, which made me want to linger in the restaurant for a long time. Thank you to Miss Sarah for being so friendly and humorous.        "
Veranda Hotel Pakubuwono,Yun Sik Mike Choi,1.0,"The hotel was carrying out a paint job at night 11:00PM. When the staff answered my complaint call and could not provide an answer, she pretended she couldn't hear me anymore and decided to hang up. Because the paint smell was coming into my room through ventilation, I couldn't sleep well throughout the whole night and had a terrible headache the next day. Truly one of the worst experiences I've ever had at any hotel."
Veranda Hotel Pakubuwono,Leksy Jordan,5.0,"Good ambience. Clean room. Convenient location. Efficient check in and check out process. Thanking Laras, Gian, Mujianafor the excellent service.

Veranda Hotel Pakubuwono,Trip.com Member,,"Great hotel,  service was excellent especially the restaurant for breakfast.   The manager Mr. Umeda-even came up to say hi to me.  Room was perfect in size and the small clinks were solved by the staff promptly and smoothly.   Great value for the money!"
Veranda Hotel Pakubuwono,Wanasarah Purba,5.0,"The hotel is really comfy! It's a really great choice to choose this hotel for a staycation (especially if u have a concert to attend at GBK). I love how clean the room is and how helpful the staff is to us. Special thanks to mas Diki for helping us with things while we're there, it means a lot for us!

Thank you, Veranda. We sure will choose this hotel again once we come to Jakarta."
Veranda Hotel Pakubuwono,Andre Gemalasatria Lolong,4.0,"Comfort and nice place to stay. Good breakfast too. Located in the heart ok Jakarta Selatan. Good for staycation or bring relatives from another town or country

Food & drinks: Had a good breakfast, Croissant were tasty, I can tell by the texture, its light brow color and taste. Sandwich and even the pootidge were good too"
Veranda Hotel Pakubuwono,Shivani Mishra,5.0,"Pretty good hotel for long stay with all the comfort. Rooms are neat & tidy and cleaned everyday by staff. The breakfast spread is really good and the restaurant serves a variety of continental and local dishes. The staff is very generous and polite and always ready to help.

Veranda Hotel Pakubuwono,andar irwansyah,1.0,Actually the room was comfy but the service was extremely poor.. the internet didn't work even after calling the reception to fix it  many times & the answer was so sorry that we had a problem with the wifi at your room that cannot be solved tonight.. never thought to stay there any longer
Veranda Hotel Pakubuwono,Trip.com Member,,"The hotel is good. The city of Jakarta is very good. It is very convenient to live here and take a taxi, but there are not many business districts around. Generally speaking, it is a quiet place. It is a good place."
Veranda Hotel Pakubuwono,Minjae KWON,5.0,"Loved it.

Rooms: The beds were really comfortable and the AC was properly activated making the experience more enjoyable without complains.

Service: The room cleaning was really good. When we came out for breakfast and returned, the rooms were good as new.

Location: I just liked the view of this place and the weather was always pretty good for swimming.

Overall, a really good place to stay, recommended."
Veranda Hotel Pakubuwono,Omar Hj Ibrahim,5.0,"One of the best boutique hotel in Jakarta. Besides the accommodation, location and ambience, the services provided is excellent and over the top. Kudos to all the staff that always makes my stay here really wonderful. I've always feel at home here so much so that I've save the address as home on my phone. My place whenever I'm in Jakarta.
Special thanks and compliments to Ms Yanisa and Kiki.

Safety: Its a small, private and safe here."
Veranda Hotel Pakubuwono,Azira Umar,5.0,"Im super please with this hotel. Good hotel, super comfortable room, delicious breakfast. Worth your money spend on this hotel ❤️

Rooms: Good pillow & good bed

Food & drinks: Great selection of breakfast buffet"
Veranda Hotel Pakubuwono,Muhamad AmRi,4.0,"Overall veranda is a pretty nice hotel located in the city center of jakarta. Not too pricey. The hotel is pretty clean and neat. However, they are shortage of key card, hence one room only get one card. To be noted that, the deluxe is not too spacious. I’d say it is a budget hotel with a bit of better service and decor. Do select the grand deluxe type for more spacious hotel room.

Overall it is pretty nice to stay at veranda hotel..

Nearby activities: Strategic location for a budget hotel."
Veranda Hotel Pakubuwono,Sondang “Sera Sera” Siregar,5.0,"Nice hotel, good ambience, and good staff especially ms Sarah frm.GRO. thank you so much for your hospitally.

Nearby activities: Close to mall Gandaria"
Veranda Hotel Pakubuwono,Patcharawut Supakong,5.0,"Overall is good. The room is clean and the location is near Gandaria city mall. Sadly, I have to minus 1 point because  the manager at Wyl’s kitchen asked us to pay for a small cup of hot water which is higher than the price we bought the cup noodles!! Even though it is not a big money but I see it a poor kindness and service of your hotel that you have done this to customers who booked a room with your hotel for 2 rooms and 3 nights each. Except this issue, all are good."
Veranda Hotel Pakubuwono,sipa alviana,5.0,"The recommendation for the Veranda hotel is extraordinary i am very happy to stay here the service is very good end friendly the place is also clean i am very happy with the concierge who shifts tonight Mr. Muzi and Mr Lana,
Thanks"
Veranda Hotel Pakubuwono,Trip.com Member,,"Overall hotel review is 7/10 but my concern is at the resto (Wyl's) is 5/10,  i ordered some Avocado Juice/avocado coffee.Once the serve said they didn't have avo juice, after a while they said they have avo juice, and it's pure from avo fruit, not flavoring. But when it was served, the color was Pale and it taste like avo flavoring with blended cream. Too bad i didn't take any pictures.Other side, the ambiance was really nice."

Veranda Hotel Pakubuwono,Alifa Dimanti,4.0,"The rooms was fine, clean and neat
The ambience also fine
But when we stayed there, took a lot of time to order room service.
1st time, we've waited for 20 minutes before they took our phone just to order foods. Second time (1 hour later, need to re-order food for the kid), they didnt even picked up the phone. Trying almost 30 mnts back then, so I gave up. Ordered from gojek instead.     "
Veranda Hotel Pakubuwono,Bharati Bhattacharya,5.0,We had a nice stay. The check in & out were hassle free. The staffs are friendly & had good service. The room was big & clean. There's a clean pool that operate 6am - 8pm. Overall will recommend
Veranda Hotel Pakubuwono,Takahiro Nishiwaki,5.0,"Nice serviced hotel.
I totally satisfied with the service they provide.
I come to understand that co-worker recommended here.

Nearby activities: It's regrettable that there are no place to buy groceries.
It would be nicer if there is a convenience stores nearby or minimart is inside the venue."
Veranda Hotel Pakubuwono,Aldy Rasyid,5.0,"Went to the hotel for a business meeting. Greeted warmly by the concierge Mr. Kiki. The lobby was very comfortable and spacious, now I'm very interested to stay in the hotel.

Well done, Hotel Veranda"
Goodrich Suites,Vincent T,2.0,"Bad wifi signal, I had to use mobile data as it doesn't even reach the bed. A 3 rating hotel at best while somehow having a 5 star rating. While the hotel has decent rooms and exudes an air of luxury, it lacks the refinement that usually begins at 4 star hotels, mediocre food, poor use of digital media, lack of care for small details and the rooms do not accommodate for foreign travelers. There are often parties on Friday night in this area, so expect a bit of noise from outside and a lot of noise downstairs.

Rooms: Starting with the pro its a decent room, spacious, great bathroom with fancy electronic toilet seats and good hot water, the laminate wood flooring is not cold to the feet. The cons are significant, the room has poor soundproofing with sounds easily coming from the next room and outside, many local power outlets with poor power draw, no office table for working with a laptop. Furthermore, some aspects of the room look well worn and show obvious signs of wear. The do not disturb and make up room is an obscure switch.

Food & drinks: Glorified warung (street stall) food. The soup noodles are similar to instant noodles, fish and chips have low quality batter for the fish. Sate however is quite good. The breakfast area at one point was reserved, pushing guests outside and to the back where we had to pass through smokers and people swimming in the pool. Soft drinks are overpriced.

Noteworthy details: BAD WIFI SIGNAL! The speed is good, but the connection quality is very bad and doesn't reach much of the room, I had to use mobile data most of the time. The use of digital electronics is very poor, with the QR for in room dining being just a page full of ads. Even the TV ads use low quality images. The hotel also often do not cater for international guests, many not knowing how to accept payment with foreign credit card. On a small note, the lobby and other areas are over perfumed."
Goodrich Suites,Tania Federica,1.0,Mba marketing eventnya ga niat ladenin tamu & ga professional. Untung all team resto very helpful & ramah. Will not recommend this to all people who wanna arrange event here if she was still the marketing of this hotel.
Goodrich Suites,Prihadi Ramadhany,5.0,"3rd time stayed in this hotel, they have different room layout, my favorite room layout is room with number ending with 16 (e.g. 516, 416, etc.).  Toilet seat is heated and has many function buttons.

Location is at south Jakarta, where Kemang, Simatupang, Cipete, Fatmawati is nearby.

Its nice & quite hotel, except for Friday where its a

little bit crowded in parking area because people

coming for their restaurant & cafe on 8th floor. Room service f&b is good, tried gado-gado, oxtail soup and soto betawi.

Bfast selections its similar to most hotels, bread, pastry, fresh juice and western/indonesian food selections.

Checkin g checkout process is fast.

Will back for sure"
Goodrich Suites,tsakila dania,4.0,"Cheapest and the most best value for money for 5 star hotel in jakarta! Breakfast was AMAZING and cheap. I would recommend this place! Amazing and unique interior design! Huge room with a bathtub! You have to notice something tho, there are a lot of illegal racing at night ( can be loud ), Small pool, a lot of dirty small details or scratched. And a pretty much small hotel for a 5 star. Staff was friendly and amazing tho! Well there are some minus and plus but I personally can tolerate the minus. But I would say its a 4 star hotel instead of 5. I would still recommend it because of the price, bath tub and breakfast!"
Goodrich Suites,Pavan KAPOOR,5.0,We attended a church event here last week and the function room was very a very good size for our group. The ambience of the hotel lobby is amazing too.
Goodrich Suites,Trip.com Member,,"The room was good, clean and the place very strategic.We give 3 star for the facilities since the AC very hot until the engineer fixed it. The wifi also needed to fix, to make it more faster network, and very sorry since they dont provide the refrigerator (only coolbar)."
Goodrich Suites,Jojo S,3.0,"I am honestly disappointed with the service from workers at a 5 star class hotel in an elite area, namely in Kemang. Before I entered the hotel, I registered via WhatsApp asking for a baby bed for my toddler. Even when I arrived at the hotel, I reminded him again. I even called 2 or 3 times to ask why it hasn't been delivered yet. I even brought my stuff to my room myself because there was only one tool to carry customer's stuff to their room. Seriously for a 5 star hotel?? For the room and bathroom I was quite satisfied because it was big and quite clean. Then for breakfast, I eat at 09.45 in the morning which is they close at 10.30 but some of the food is empty and cold and then not refilled. In any hotel I stay, it's not even a 5-star hotel, even if the food runs out and closing time is still quite far, it's always refilled. Quite shocked. Then for the taste of the food apart from dessert, honestly quite disappointed again. Even on the table there is no tissue. My child accidentally spilled the infusion water then under the baby's chair was full of water and I asked some woman to clean it along with saying sorry for the trouble. The woman who guards the coffee machine idk the name with an unfriendly face just looks at it and nods her head. A man came long enough just to clean the floor. And indeed this woman is quite unfriendly to customers, yes, because there is no greeting whatsoever because when I entered the breakfast room I felt wow, it was really bad, there was no one guarding the front to ask what room it was from. Come in, just come in   even the workers there, if they run into a customer, don't say hello, just pass by. My suggestion it would be better if the workers were retrained for the sake of the continuity of this hotel itself, because my husband (a foreigner) gave an opinion that this hotel actually had to improve for many things because he had never found a 5 star hotel with service and breakfast  like this. Parking area is also very limited. Sorry but this is an honest review from me."
Goodrich Suites,Jeffry Johannes,1.0,Stayed here multiple times and this is the worse experience. Got tricked by the receptionist name Dela. Lack of coordination between breakfast room and receptionist
Goodrich Suites,miranda warokka,5.0,"went here for workshop and seminar, don't know the room ,but I love the pool"
Goodrich Suites,felliks montolalu,5.0,"Comfy place, near to lippo mall kemang. One of the best place for staycation with your partner/family

Food & drinks: the foods and the staff all good.."
Goodrich Suites,cut emyra,4.0,"The hotel location very good near Kemang and near main road so easily accessible. The room also big and bath tub also available in certain type of room. Also available bar at the rooftop so you can easily hang out without go outside.

But, the services (in the restaurant) quite dissapointed and they need more train their waiter."
Goodrich Suites,Juan Wrik,5.0,"Best hotel for noiseless sleep in even the still busy south jakarta and the superb clean bathroom,  all of it due to the intentiveness & initiaive of the staff, who also helps even after you checked out."
Goodrich Suites,Nadya Yolanda Moeda,3.0,"Checking out tomorrow but the last few hours staying here speak volumes about their overall service. An hour of waiting for two bottles of drinking water? Ridiculous. But the food is excellent     If I were to come back, it’d be because of their food."
Goodrich Suites,Claire Bohrer,1.0,"Avoid at all costs! Never have I ever had such a miserable experience at a hotel (side note, this hotel is 3 star at best; the 5 star description is laughable).

Firstly, each night the hotel hosts events on the third and eight floor. Events with DJs and loud base and these hotel rooms are not sound proof. It doesn’t matter which floor you are on, the noise will carry and you will not get sleep until the event ends. Other issues include ratty towels with stains and bathrobes with holes large enough for your leg to fit through. The front desk attendants are also inattentive and won’t even give your room a call when you have a delivery. I cannot find a single nice thing to say."
Goodrich Suites,Adhika Mafran,4.0,"Affordable price for 5 star hotel.

Rooms :
Roadway noise, you can hear car's horn in the middle of the night. Like the room doesn't have soundproof.
The room has a sofa window and you can see others windows from here.

Buffet : Limited choice
Staff : Pleasant staff."
Goodrich Suites,Rizki Ikhbar,5.0,"Nice hotel and good food, strategic location in Antasari near Kemang, Goodrich Suites, Artotel indeed an artsy hotel and it also has very beautiful view in dusk, what a lovely hotel to stay with your beloved couple, a very recommended hotel to try, thank you Artotel."
Goodrich Suites,Takeshi Kiri,5.0,"Fairly new boutique hotel opened in 2018 with spacious rooms, bathtubs in every room (yes the water is filtered), and a hip 8th floor bar called the Roosevelt Room. Well managed, clean. modern, and reasonbly welcoming to foreigners, I recommend this hotel. Also, the breakfast buffet cannot compete with the big hotels but it's still qyotw decent. I found the quality to be quite good."
Goodrich Suites,Zizi Suherman,1.0,"The royal suite that turn down our expectations, the toilet door couldnt properly closed, no idea where the water suction for bathtub spillage are going, pretty much flooded by it on the bathroom floor , dont get me to differentiate hot water and cold water coz both are just cold in any day of a situations..

surprisingly the suite is even more approriate, no flaws."
Goodrich Suites,Erly Tunriallu,4.0,"After read the recent reviews so I decided to request few things when I booked and check in.
- Quite room and not in front the toll road.
- King size bed and non smoking
- Not same floor with bar/restaurant

And I got quite and nice room but some things really need to be improve and it have been informed by many others guests:
1. Pillows must be changed it with new because it was too thin to sleep with and not clean enough.
2. Towels must be changed with new or you must laundry with bayclin and citric acid so it's help to returns the white colour  and brighter. Give some softener, too.
3. The aircon need to improve not cool at all, we asked engineers and they responded fast but the aircon still on off. They offered to change the room but we declined since we stay only 1 night.
4. The vitrass has broken, need to changed/replace and Gordyn need to wash..quite dirty.
5. Water washer on off between hot and cold.. need to be service and maintain well.

Good values:
1. All staffs are very nice, friendly, welcome and fast response since at security at parking area, receptionist at lobby, engineering staffs, housekeeping, waiters at restaurant.
All of them very nice and friendly.

2. Very spacious room and bathroom with nice view to Kemang Mall

3. All the room from bedroom, bathroom, toilet, public place, Restaurant, Gym, are clean and spotless.

4. Strategic location near to toll road, Kemang Mall, restaurants around Kemang.

Hope my review will help you, thanks     "
Goodrich Suites,Cha,5.0,"Such a good experience for me to stay in this hotels, great ambiance but the most important is great location

Nearby activities: There is a mall nearby and also tons of food that you can buy online"
Goodrich Suites,Charista Lovapinka,5.0,Super nice hotel with great hospitality and delicous breakfast as well. Definitely will come back to this hotel for staycation     please keep the good service!
Goodrich Suites,Barried Gharizah,1.0,"Stayed in the Royal Suites Room. Room was decent however the layout was totally different from the advertised pictures. We booked the room because we wanted to enjoy the bath tub by the window but we didn’t get that. Understand that the availability is limited, but still disappointed. This wasn’t what we booked for.
Another issue was with the water. It was yellow/brown! Definitely don’t want to soak my body in that water. Complained and the staff just told us to keep draining the water until it is clear. We never had experienced this in any other hotel! They should clean their water tank/pipes!!
The room was also not soundproof. During the night, we kept hearing the music from the club downstairs and even from the nearby neighborhood event in the morning.
They offered compensation (free breakfast) but still it wasn’t an enjoyable stay."
Goodrich Suites,Alicia Gracielle,2.0,"The room service is so slow. They used QR code to order the room service but it seemed like they didnt standby at the website. I ordered chicken corn soup at 10.48 but my food came at 12.05. I asked the receptionist to relay my message to the housekeeping to clean my room when im about to go out. But when i came back my room wasnt clean yet. Also the last night i stayed here, the security told that the only way to park is through valet cause the hotel was packed, so we did. But the morning when i checked out, my car was broken down and couldnt be started. Turns out they left my car on and didnt turned it off through the night so my car’s battery was out. Such a shame when the room and ambience is actually nice."
Goodrich Suites,Citra,5.0,"Was here just for a night. I like the concept of this hotel. It felt warm, comfy and homey. Also when I walked into lobby, I really like the smell. Smell fancy and calm.
I came at 13:00ish, and I tried to check in. I wasn’t be able to check in at first because check in time is on 14:00. So I wait on the lobby. Then suddenly the staff call me out and tell me that I can early check in. So I headed to the room after they gave me cards.
Room was quite spacious, covered with carpet which I like, but the aircon doesn’t feel cool enough even tho I put the number 17/18 degree.
I like the composition of the color.
Toilet was high tech, the seat was heated. Like a toilet in Japan.
Everything at room was great.
Bfast was not so good. I had my omelet, and it tasted not so fresh, idk why.
the nasi goreng kampong is very tasty, I also get my 2nd plate.
Bfast varieties is very limited, as a 5 star hotel, I expect more. :(
Overall taste was okay. Which I also expect more.
Pool’s great. But I sometimes get shy bcs it placed in the front of the restaurant."
Goodrich Suites,Ray's mom,3.0,"Check-in process: almost 15 minutes standing in front of reception and I was the only guest at that time! She looked like she was busy doing something behind the counter, pacing between desks 1 and 2 while processing my check-in. This is totally unacceptable.

Room: facing the street on the 4th floor, no soundproof at all! We could hear everything from the street. The sound is very disturbing if a motorbike is speeding in the middle of the night with a loud noisy exhaust. Please, do something to make the windows soundproof.

The mini fridge : not working. All drinks inside are not cold at all.

Bathroom: speechless about the towels quality. It's a thin and dirty white color towel. Rather a 2-3 star hotel towel. And no small/hand/face towels. Only 2 towels with poor quality and torn edges.. what?! This is supposed to be a 5 star hotel, right?

Breakfast : limited variety

The good thing is the bathroom has marble with separate shower and nice bathtub. Wifi is good."
Goodrich Suites,Marssel Pratama,3.0,"Pros : Neat and spacious room with bathtub. Great internet.
Cons : The cleanliness of the room can be improved. Bad for light sleeper because the location is near the highway and you can hear the sound of the traffic since the room is not soundproof. Not so many variant of food. They started doing like construction at 10 pm while my family is sleeping, even i had to call the front desk to stop the construction."
Goodrich Suites,Mike R,1.0,"Don't let the 5-star rating fool you. I've stayed in other 5-star hotels in Jakarta, and this one is a 3-star at best. My experience here was rather disappointing, and here's why:

Noise
The hotel is located right next to a highway, which evidently is used for illegal bike racing at night. Imagine trying to get some sleep only to be rudely awakened by the deafening screams of heavily modified underbone bikes zooming past until the wee hours of the morning. There is no soundproofing in the windows, which means you'll be hardpressed to get a good night's sleep.
Once you actually do manage to fall asleep, the dawn prayer call from the nearby mosque is loud enough to wake you once again.

Fittings & Furniture
The furniture is mediocre, and the fittings are in dire need of repair.
- Thin, tiny pillows on a king-sized bed
- Shower temperature goes from freezing cold to scalding hot and back to cold. no matter how you set it
- Lights are extremely dim, some don't work
- The mini-fridge in my room didn't work and had to be replaced
- Curtains had cigarette burn marks, and smell like they haven't been washed in months
- Closet smelled like wet dog for some reason

Restaurant/Buffet breakfast
- Buffet is pedestrian with limited choice
- On my second day I was told they are not serving a buffet and I had to choose between 'Asian' and 'American' breakfast. The 'American' breakfast was 2 pieces of cheap bread, one slice of beef bacon, mushrooms, half a tomato with a quarter slice of Kraft cheese on it, and some fruit.

Staff
- The staff was pleasant, but Room Service is quite slow. I had to call 3 times just to get a bucket of ice delivered. It took them over an hour.

Overall I wouldn't recommend this hotel as there are much nicer ones in Jakarta for the price."
Goodrich Suites,Dian Onno,1.0,"Booked the ballroom for a dinner event, very dissapointed with the food and slow service. I don't blame the waiters there I think they are freelancers specially hired for the event, but I did put the blame on the service quality standard. The food was terrible, rice was dry, we paid 500k± for a plate of mediocre food. Even the 50k nasi kotak we had for lunch event was better. There were no glass served at the drink station. When the guests arrived, the food wasn't served yet, and the guests were actually came late! and still the food not ready. Very unpleasant and humiliating experience to our guests. Will not book here will not reccomend either. We don't use the rooms, btw so I can only comment on the food and banquet service. Still can't believe that this is a 5-star hotel."
Goodrich Suites,Andreas Reyan,5.0,"Great hotel for your vacation or staycation, Goodrich offers a luxury room with a very reasonable price. The room is super clean, the bathroom is pleasant and the bed is comfortable. It is a very recommended place to stay with your family, your S.O., or even solo traveling."
Goodrich Suites,Nicholas Kristian,1.0,very noisy with the sound of motorbikes racing from midnight to morning.  especially weekends are not suitable for those looking for peace and rest at this hotel
Hotel Gran Mahakam,Samuel Halim,5.0,"I love small luxurious hotel like Gran Mahakam which is strategically located and surrounded by lots of foods, drinks, hanging out places
.
Organized several events here and found the helpful and friendly staffs from inside out. Never stayed in the room tho
.
Food is ok. Coffee is great"
Hotel Gran Mahakam,Mr T,5.0,"I stayed in this hotel for a day. The staffs are friendly and had attended to all our needs. I had booked the room on the 6th floor. So I had a pretty good view for the vicinity. The rooftop swimming pool also had a calm feeling to it. I had the morning buffet in the hotel and I can confidently say, it’s one of the best I’ve eaten so far. I would recommend this hotel to everyone."
Hotel Gran Mahakam,pendri anto,4.0,"Hadir ke hotel ini sebagai partisipan UK-INDONESIA HEALTH GENOMIC S FORUM 2023 di ruang magnolia.

Overall good view and place.
Grateful to attended here for above event, with minor suggestion for the hotel's management, especially on meal's menus that offer to their custmers.

Hope the hotel management comply with regulation run on Indonesia especially on labelling halal on non halal meals (UU JPH) so moslem customer have an option on that.

Become a Moslem friendly hotel."
Hotel Gran Mahakam,Nadiah Ismahsari,5.0,"A classic, old boutique hotel. The room is a bit smaller but super comfortable. Breakfast didn't have too many choices but was all delicious. Excellent service and hospitality. Couldn't ask for more it was a very pleasant stay."
Hotel Gran Mahakam,Hafiz Hassan,5.0,Hands down the best hotel that I’ve experienced by far. Awesome service from their friendliest staff. Will definitely repeat our stay here!
Hotel Gran Mahakam,Gavin Young,5.0,"The Hotel Gran Mahakam is a must stay in Jakarta. From the time you book in until the time you check out the location and staff are amazing. We booked the Gran Mahakam Suite, which was well worth every cent. The pool area is small but still fantastic.

Blok M shopping right outside and the MRT a short walk and can take you where you need to go.

Overall, you will not be disappointed at all if you decide to stay at the Hotel Gran Mahakam     "
Hotel Gran Mahakam,Muhammad Fauzi,5.0,"I recently had the pleasure of staying at Hotel Gran Mahakam, and I must say, it exceeded my expectations in every way. Located in a prime area, this hotel offers a unique concept that combines luxury, convenience, and a culinary adventure all in one.

Let's start with the concept. Hotel Gran Mahakam stands out from other hotels in the area due to its distinctive design and ambiance. The interior decor is a perfect blend of contemporary elegance and traditional Indonesian elements, creating a warm and welcoming atmosphere.

Whether you're craving local delicacies, international cuisine, or something in between, you'll find it all within a short walking distance from the hotel.

The menu features an impressive array of dishes that cater to different tastes and preferences. From traditional Indonesian favorites to international specialties, the restaurant offers a diverse selection that guarantees to please even the most discerning palates.

In addition to the delectable food, the restaurant's ambiance was delightful. The cozy yet elegant setting provided a relaxed atmosphere that was perfect for enjoying a meal.

Hotel Gran Mahakam,Swathi,5.0,"My stay was a combination of quarantine and normal stay. Easily the best quarantine food I have had so far. Delightful desserts included too!

The hotel was not fully open due to CoVID closure of the spa and limited pool service.

However everything else was delightful. The staff and service was amazing, they assisted swiftly on all matters. The food at the restaurant was delicious.  For guests with breakfast options, they even had complimentary in room breakfast."
Hotel Gran Mahakam,Robert Gow,4.0,"Old boutique hotel but very well maintained. Reception, concierge, restaurant, housekeeping and security staff ALL very polite and helpful.
In-room amenities are complete . I stayed in a standard room then later upgraded to deluxe suite and found the bedding in both very comfortable. There were insufficient number of power outlets accommodate my laptop and chargers for tablet and phone, so I purchased a cable extension at the Block-M Mall which is conveniently located 200 meters from the hotel.
I can highly recommend the Gran Mahakam Hotel for both business and family travel."

The only complaint from them is the access to the hotel on a Saturday night was heavy traffic. Thank you Gran Mahakam"
Hotel Gran Mahakam,Tummy Mate,4.0,"Been here for 1 night stay at junior suite using voucher from Tada. We are so comfortable and satisfied with the room. Breakfast is really good at taste but it's not really much choice as the other 5 star hotel. Overall the experience staying at Gran Mahakam is very good especially for super hospitable and helpful staff.

Hotel type : Classic, modern and elegant
Room : Good and well maintenance.
Breakfast : All the dishes are delicious.
Facility : Pool and sauna not really big. But it's useful and clean.
Staff : Very welcoming and helpful
Location : Near Mall Blok M plaza, Taman Mahakam, MRT Station and lot of street food around hotel.
Suggestions : I would say this hotel is perfect choice for business trip or work gathering.

Notes : I booked the room 1 week before arrival, but when i check in at 03.00pm, the room is not ready yet, and need to wait almost 1 hour until we can go to our room. But we get late check out at 01.00pm."
